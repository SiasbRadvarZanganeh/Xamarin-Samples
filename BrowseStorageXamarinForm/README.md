### **Introduction**
This is a sample code written in C# that uses **Xamarin.Forms** and **.NET** functionality on the [**Xamarin Platform**] (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin) to browse the application storage on the iPhone or the Android device. It allows the programmer to select the file in an application.

- I have written this code and publish it as open source so others could also use it if they want. Also, some people wanted to see my code, since I usually donâ€™t publish open source code. It is written to be useful. It is not necessarily complete, It is meant as code snippet to be integrated into your code if you want.

- I have written it according to View-ModelView-Model concepts in Xamarin.Form. The code behind the XAML in the View, only Initializes the Components of the XAML pages.

- I have not written any Unit tests for this project.

- I have tested the application on the:
    * iPhone SE (IOS 13.3.1)
    * Simulator: iPhone 11 Pro Max (IOS 13.3)
    * SKY 4.0D (Android 4.4.2) - Android 4.4.2 Kit Kat. API level 19 (the target is set to Android 8.1, API level 27)
    * Emulator: Android_27 (API 27)

- Information on [**file system access in Xamarin:**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/app-fundamentals/file-system)

>### **IOS setup**
You need to add the following 2 properties to the **info.plist** in the IOS section of your project.

>- **LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace** - **Yes**  :  If you want to see your files in the Files App
- **UIFileSharingEnabled** - **Yes** : Application supports iTunes sharing

### Features
- Uses CollectionView.
- Uses only Xamarin.Forms, and .net file access.
 - One directory listing per page.
 - Folder button of a directory in a listing leads to a new page with that sub-directory listings.
 - A path of each directory listing at the top of the page.
 - Navigation title shows the directory name on a sub-directory listing.
 - Android tabs at the bottom of the page are implemented.
 - DataTemplet selection according to file or directory is implemented.
 - File and directory names are sorted according to name.
 - Consistent colour thyme is used for legibility.
 - A consistent material design for application was done. (Used Sketch)
 - Sample data files are part of resources of the application. They are extracted at start of the application for test.


### Not implemented
- Thumbnail of files are not implemented.
- Sorting of files according to other criteria like creation time is not implemented.
- Multi directory items in columns on page display. With Collection view it should be easy.
- A SearchBar is not implemented to filter the directories and files in a directory listing.
